# Forge: a theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org)

This is the demo website for the theme used by my personal website.
Perfect for small, minimal, but clean looking websites for software developers looking for:

- A lightweight site: minimal CSS and JavaScript.
- Mathematical typesetting with [KaTeX](https://katex.org).
- Hosting a blog.
- Presenting a portfolio.

Designed for and used by [my personal website](https://wingelaar.be).
